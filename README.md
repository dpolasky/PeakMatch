This repository contains the sequence annotation code used to process data for 
"Chemical modification enables enhanced top-down sequencing of intact protein complexes"
by Daniel A. Polasky, Frederik Lermyte, Michael Nshanian, Philip C. Andrews, Joseph A. Loo, and Brandon T. Ruotolo.

This code is not optimized for general use (e.g. directories are hard-coded, there almost no interface, and the code
is not particularly modular), but it is available for viewing and confirmation of methods used in the paper. If you
would like to use part or all of the code in the repository, you may do so under the terms of the GPL v3 provided you
cite the paper referenced above in any academic works that make any use of the code.
